        From the station (KTX or Bus) a taxi is the quickest way to get to the beach. Also won’t be too expensive, especially with a few friends. Say: 영일대해수욕장 (Yong-il Day Bee-Chi). Another option that would cost less, but take more time, is the city BUS (Blue Bus: 101, 105, 130, 131, 200, 700 Green Bus: 176, 600).

        <div>It’s a short beautiful walk down the beach to the party location TILT. 
Prices range depending on room size for the hotel (# of people) and the guesthouse has various sleeping arrangements.

        <div>Additionally there are countless hotels along the beach and in the neighborhood surrounding it. In Korea we don’t usually book accommodation in advance, but walk into motels checking prices after playing for the day. The rooms along the beach range from (70,000 - 120,000) for a night, and can get lower as you go away from the beach, with size/quality being the largest factors. You can fit numerous people into a room, people will be looking for roommates. If you’re unsure about hotels, message us with any concerns.</div>
